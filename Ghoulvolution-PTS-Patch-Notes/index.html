<div class="update bnetArticle-bnetArticle38 bnetArticle-bnetArticle41  heading_md article-el-h3">Ghoulification</div>
<div class="paragraph">For the first time in Fallout history, YOU will be able to play as a Ghoul. Starting the new
    questline “Leap of Faith” will take you into a new section of the Savage Divide. There you will meet characters
    who will aid in your transformation. Unlocking the new Ghoul-specific abilities Glow and Feral as well as the
    new Ghoul exclusive Perks.</div>
<div class="bnetArticle-bnetArticle38 bnetArticle-bnetArticle42  heading_md article-el-h3">Ghoulities (Abilities)
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><strong>Feral</strong></div>
<div class="paragraph">Becoming a Ghoul sheds the need to sate your hunger and thirst. Instead, you battle against a
    gnawing desire to slip back into your base nature. Abandoning all sanity you might have had.</div>
<div class="paragraph">The new Feral meter drains overtime and can only be filled back up by consuming Chems. You
    may not want to keep that meter 100% filled though. Your Feral status provides different bonuses and penalties
    depending on how full the meter is. </div>
<ul>
    <li>Above 80%: you gain +3 Strength, +3 Endurance, +30 Max HP</li>
    <li>Above 60%: you gain +15 Max HP</li>
    <li>Above 40%: you lose -1 Endurance and -5 Max HP</li>
    <li>Above 20%: you lose -3 Endurance, -15 Max HP, -10 Max AP</li>
    <li>At 0%: you gain +200% Melee Damage, and lose -5 Endurance, -30 Max HP, -20 Max AP, -300% Hip-fire Gun
        Accuracy &amp; V.A.T.S. Accuracy (a few people on the team have been known to call it Ghoulzerker or
        Ghoularian Mode)</li>
</ul>
<div class="paragraph"><strong>Glow</strong></div>
<div class="paragraph">As you might expect when living life as a Ghoul, radiation doesn’t have the same effect on
    you as it does on the smooth-skinned. You’re immune to diseases and cannot be mutated by nearby radiation. As a
    Ghoul, radiation makes you Glow! </div>
<div class="paragraph">This new Glow system increases your maximum health (and heals damage you’ve taken) based on
    the amount of radiation that you’ve accumulated. Your Glow can be tracked by the green-striped pattern on your
    HP bar.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Consuming tainted foods, drinks, and exploring irradiated environments all contribute to your
    Glow. If you hear that Pip-Boy ticking, the radiation is hitting. While you’re in Power Armor, your radiation
    intake can be seen on the “Rads” dial next to your health. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Outside of the max health increase Glow provides, it also contributes to Perks like the
    Science Monster and Jaguar Speed Perks mentioned below! </div>
<div class="bnetArticle-bnetArticle38 bnetArticle-bnetArticle42  heading_md article-el-h3">Gherks (Perks)</div>
<div class="paragraph">One benefit of living life as a Ghoul is that you’ll have access to a new suite of Perk cards
    that you can use in addition to the normal human cards . There are 28 Perks to choose from and 2 new Legendary
    perks for Ghouls. </div>
<div class="paragraph">The new Perk cards can be attained through Perk card packs or by selecting your level-up
    Perk. These cards will open new build opportunities and enhance the way you play. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Do note that Perk cards that revolve around Hunger, Thirst, and the Chem Resistant perk will
    be locked as Ghouls don’t require the benefits that those cards provide. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Let’s look at one Perk from each S.P.E.C.I.A.L. category (all Perk descriptions are at their
    max value):</div>
<ul>
    <li>Strength:
        <ul>
            <li>Bone Shatterer – Your melee weapon attacks have a 45% chance to cripple a limb.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Perception:
        <ul>
            <li>Eye of The Hunter – Your vision allows you to be more accurate in V.A.T.S. from a very long
                distance.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Endurance:
        <ul>
            <li>Glowing Gut - Irradiated food and drink grant 300% more rads.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Charisma:
        <ul>
            <li>Moral Support – When on a team, you become feral 50% slower.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Intelligence:
        <ul>
            <li>Science Monster – While you have Glow, gain 15% bonus damage for 10 seconds upon getting hit.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Agility:
        <ul>
            <li>Jaguar Speed – You now sprint 20% faster when your Glow is high (Greater than or equal to 180 Glow).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Luck:
        <ul>
            <li>Wild West Hands – 36% chance to instantly reload your entire magazine when empty.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <div class="miner-note"><strong>Miner Note</strong>: Here's all the Ghoul perks<br />
    
    </div>
</ul>
<div class="bnetArticle-bnetArticle38 bnetArticle-bnetArticle42  heading_md article-el-h3">A Ghoul’s Day Out</div>
<div class="paragraph">With all these new benefits that help you explore the wasteland; we would forgive you for
    thinking that life as a Ghoul was easy. No matter how well dressed you are, there are still some factions (like
    the Brotherhood of Steel) who won’t want to interact with you. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Playing as a Ghoul will make some factions hostile to you which will lock you out of quest
    lines. Luckily wearing disguises made by Jaye, a new NPC you’ll meet along the new questline, will allow you to
    interact with any blocked content that you may find when living life as a Ghoul.</div>
<div class="paragraph">There are a few trade-offs though:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Sprinting will cost 50% more AP</li>
    <li>Feral Meter depletion rate is increased by 30</li>
    <li>Movement speed is slightly slower</li>
    <li>Super Overencumbrance (drastic AP drain and forced slow-walk)</li>
</ul>
<div class="paragraph">Don’t worry. If after a short while you find out that being a Ghoul isn’t for you, you can
    switch back to being human through your Character Screen. Just know, this is a one-way ticket back. You won’t be
    able to complete the questline to become a Ghoul again. </div>
<div class="bnetArticle-bnetArticle38 bnetArticle-bnetArticle41  heading_md article-el-h3">The Big Bloom</div>
<div class="paragraph">Spring is coming and we wanted to introduce a new themed event to match. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Introducing Black-Eyed Susan, a new friendly NPC who is sure to remind you of a grandmother.
    She loves flowers, floral arrangements, and totally doesn’t have a secret backstory so stop asking. Susan needs
    help with her latest project and luckily for her there are a bunch of Vault Dwellers who are ready and willing
    to help. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Black-Eyed Susan’s favorite meadow has been overtaken by strange, plant-like beasts called
    Overgrown making the area too dangerous for her to pick flowers. So, she needs you to head into the meadow, pick
    some flowers, and defeat those monsters. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Do watch out for the mines though. They’re the remnants of a previous attempt to keep those
    beasts out of her meadow. </div>
<div class="bnetArticle-bnetArticle38 bnetArticle-bnetArticle41  heading_md article-el-h3">Perks Catalog</div>
<div class="paragraph">The Perks Catalog is a new way of viewing and organizing your Perk card collection. It's
    filterable, sortable, has 2 different views, and even lets you tag specific cards for search. Check it out by
    opening your loadout and pressing the "All Perks" button on the left-hand side of your screen (LT on controller,
    M on mouse &amp; keyboard). Let us know what you think! </div>
<div class="bnetArticle-bnetArticle38 bnetArticle-bnetArticle41  heading_md article-el-h3">Combat Balancing</div>
<div class="paragraph">Many pistols have been modified to incorporate the damage that they’d deal via perks
    (pre-update Gunslinger and Guerrilla) into their base damage, since those perks no-longer offer a
    pistol-specific increase to damage. In addition, some pistols have received a further increase to their base
    damage. </div>
<ul>
    <li>Pipe Gun</li>
    <li>Pipe Revolver</li>
    <li>Pipe Bolt-Action</li>
    <li>Laser Gun</li>
