<div class="paragraph">The new Feral meter drains overtime and can only be filled back up by consuming Chems. You
    may not want to keep that meter 100% filled though. Your Feral status provides different bonuses and penalties
    depending on how full the meter is. </div>

<div class="paragraph">As you might expect when living life as a Ghoul, radiation doesn’t have the same effect on
    you as it does on the smooth-skinned. You’re immune to diseases and cannot be mutated by nearby radiation. As a
    Ghoul, radiation makes you Glow! </div>
<div class="paragraph">This new Glow system increases your maximum health (and heals damage you’ve taken) based on
    the amount of radiation that you’ve accumulated. Your Glow can be tracked by the green-striped pattern on your
    HP bar.</div>
<div class="miner-note"><strong>Miner Note</strong>: As of 1/26, your Glow bar is equal in size to your health

    HP</div>
<div class="paragraph">Consuming tainted foods, drinks, and exploring irradiated environments all contribute to your
    Glow. If you hear that Pip-Boy ticking, the radiation is hitting. While you’re in Power Armor, your radiation
    intake can be seen on the “Rads” dial next to your health. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Outside of the max health increase Glow provides, it also contributes to Perks like the
    Science Monster and Jaguar Speed Perks mentioned below! </div>

    that you can use in addition to the normal human cards . There are 28 Perks to choose from and 2 new Legendary
    perks for Ghouls. </div>
<div class="paragraph">The new Perk cards can be attained through Perk card packs or by selecting your level-up

<div class="paragraph">With all these new benefits that help you explore the wasteland; we would forgive you for
    thinking that life as a Ghoul was easy. No matter how well dressed you are, there are still some factions (like
    the Brotherhood of Steel) who won’t want to interact with you. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Playing as a Ghoul will make some factions hostile to you which will lock you out of quest
    lines. Luckily wearing disguises made by Jaye, a new NPC you’ll meet along the new questline, will allow you to
    interact with any blocked content that you may find when living life as a Ghoul.</div>
<div class="paragraph">There are a few trade-offs though:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Sprinting will cost 50% more AP</li>
    <li>Feral Meter depletion rate is increased by 30</li>
    <li>Movement speed is slightly slower</li>
    <li>Super Overencumbrance (drastic AP drain and forced slow-walk)</li>
</ul>
<div class="paragraph">Don’t worry. If after a short while you find out that being a Ghoul isn’t for you, you can
    switch back to being human through your Character Screen. Just know, this is a one-way ticket back. You won’t be
    able to complete the questline to become a Ghoul again. </div>

<div class="paragraph">Introducing Black-Eyed Susan, a new friendly NPC who is sure to remind you of a grandmother.

<div class="paragraph">Black-Eyed Susan’s favorite meadow has been overtaken by strange, plant-like beasts called
    Overgrown making the area too dangerous for her to pick flowers. So, she needs you to head into the meadow, pick
