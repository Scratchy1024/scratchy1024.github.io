<div class="bnetArticle-bnetArticle38 bnetArticle-bnetArticle41  heading_md article-el-h3">The Gleaming Depths</div>
<div class="paragraph">The Gleaming Depths raid is a new endgame activity designed to be faced by a party of four
    highly leveled and geared players. Each encounter will require your party to work together to overcome unique
    coop mechanics to overcome the bosses within. These bosses may also punish some types of character builds and
    we’re sure you’ll figure out which builds are more advantageous for each fight.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Unlike Daily Ops and Expeditions, which can be cleared solo if you have the correct build,
    the Gleaming Depths will require you and your squad to take on unique roles during the encounters and
    communicate with each other. To help facilitate communication, we’re also introducing a contextual Ping system
    to allow those who may not feel comfortable with being on voice comms to assist the team. When pointed towards a
    target, the ping system will mark hostile and friendly targets, points of interest, and containers.</div>
<div class="paragraph">When designing this activity, the team laid out five core features that will make raids
    different than other repeatable content:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Require Teamwork</li>
    <li>Challenge Endgame Builds</li>
    <li>Unique Boss Fights</li>
    <li>No Time Gating</li>
    <li>High Value Rewards</li>
</ul>
<div class="paragraph">We’ve covered the first three bullet points in the opening paragraphs so now let’s cover the
    last two. </div>
<div class="paragraph">No time gating. Raids can be completed back-to-back without having to wait for a reset timer.
    If you complete the raid, you get rewards. This is important because completing raid encounters will be your
    primary source of 4-Star Legendary Mods/Items as well as other raid related rewards (such as the new Player
    Titles!).</div>
<div class="paragraph">A reminder before you go: The Gleaming Depths is intended to be challenging. A part of that
    challenge will be staying alive because your team will not be able to revive you until the encounter is finished
    (in success we hope). Don’t worry though! You can use your downtime to view the fight from your teammates
    perspective which will hopefully allow you to devise a new strategy.
    Also, make sure you utilize the new Raid Public Team before entering the raid. This will give your team a Weapon
    Durability buff that will only work in the Gleaming Depths. </div>
<div class="bnetArticle-bnetArticle38 bnetArticle-bnetArticle41  heading_md article-el-h3">4-Star Legendary Items
</div>
<div class="paragraph">With the release of the Gleaming Depths, we are expanding the current legendary system to
    take your 3-Star items and allow you turn them into 4-Star items. Opening a whole new avenue for you to modify
    your weapons and armor in ways that amplify your playstyle. These 4-Star Legendary items will be obtainable as
    drops during the raid.</div>
<div class="paragraph">To give you an idea of the new mods that await you, here’s a 4-Star Legendary mod from the
    Weapon, Power Armor, and Armors category: </div>
<ul>
    <li>4-Star Legendary Weapon Effect: Critical Hits Restore 5% of Health &amp; Action Points for Player and
        Teammates Within a 50ft Radius</li>
    <li>4-Star Legendary Power Armor Effect: Action Point Cost of V.A.T.S. Attacks Reduced by -5% (up to -25% on
        Full Stack)</li>
    <li>4-Star Legendary Armor Effect: Melee Weapons Deal +5% Bonus Damage (up to +25% on Full Stack)</li>
</ul>
<div class="paragraph">This all ties into the Legendary Crafting system that was introduced in Milepost Zero. If you
    have 4-Star Legendary Weapons and Armor, you’ll have a chance at obtaining a loose mod or learning the recipe
    when you scrap the item. Like 3-Star Mods, loose 4-Star Mods can be traded with other players. But the second
    you craft it on an item that item becomes untradeable and you cannot drop it. </div>
<div class="bnetArticle-bnetArticle38 bnetArticle-bnetArticle41  heading_md article-el-h3">C.A.M.P. Pets</div>
<div class="paragraph">Say hello to two new fuzzy friends who will help bring your C.A.M.P. to life! We’re excited
    to bring C.A.M.P. Pets to Fallout 76 starting with a Cat and a Dog. And yes, you can pet them.</div>
<div class="paragraph">You can find your C.A.M.P. Pet in the newly updated DWELLERS workshop tab and spawn them by
    placing the corresponding spawning furniture for the cat or dog - a cat bed and a doghouse. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Once placed, the animals will follow you around your C.A.M.P., idly walk, sit in their
    furniture and use their own cat scratcher or dig in their doggy bone mound (aka dirt pile). The latter furniture
    items must be placed before they will use them, and currently are found in the MISC workshop tab. </div>
<div class="paragraph">C.A.M.P. Pets will not follow you in the world - they are just that - a C.A.M.P. pet! You
    cannot have more than one at a time, but you can have one pet and one ally in your C.A.M.P.. They will not,
    however, be available in your Shelter.</div>
<div class="paragraph">To interact with your new friend, walk up to them and press the interaction buttons that you
    see when they are close. "Interact" for Pet Commands, "Customize" for Dress Up, and "Edit Name" to call them
    what you'd like (other players will NOT see your pet's name).</div>
<div class="paragraph">Through Pet Commands you can have them sit, speak, and of course, pet them through an emote
    style window.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Dress up your pet by crafting their collars at the Armor Workbench in the Pet Clothing
    section, then use the "Customize" interaction to place them on your friend. </div>
<div class="paragraph">As well as being a cute dweller in your C.A.M.P., they will also bring you an item every so
    often! This Pet Treasure system allows your fuzzy friend to show their love for you by bringing you a little
    treat! </div>
<div class="paragraph">We hope you enjoy the C.A.M.P. Pet feature as much as we did creating it!<br>Keep an eye out
    for more pets in the future! </div>
<div class="bnetArticle-bnetArticle38 bnetArticle-bnetArticle41  heading_md article-el-h3">Player Titles</div>
<div class="paragraph">Player Titles are a new way to express what’s unique about your Vault Dweller. Through your
    Pip-Boy, you can combine different prefixes and suffixes to come up with a nickname that suits you! Earnable
    from participating in Public Events, Limited Time Events, completing Main Quests, and Seasons, these unique
    titles will help you stand out from the crowd. The Gleaming Depths raid will also have its own set of titles
    that will be tied to Challenges. </div>
<div class="paragraph">For long-time players, any titles that are associated to content that you’ve already
    completed will be automatically granted to your account.</div>

    Update</div>
<div class="paragraph">The Gleaming Depths update releases with some substantial balancing changes to a handful of
    Perk Cards. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Our goal was to take generally underperforming perks and make them more interesting and

<div class="paragraph">While these weapons are still being evaluated for overall balance, these particular mods
    over-shot the current target for fire damage mods (especially when taking into account the recent adjustments to
    creature health and resistances) and are being brought in line with similar mods for other weapons. This allows
    for more consistency among weapons and mods when making future changes.</div>
<div class="bnetArticle-bnetArticle38 bnetArticle-bnetArticle42  heading_md article-el-h4">Human(ish) Creature &amp;
    Weapon Balance</div>
<div class="paragraph">Creatures that previously used player weapons (Blood Eagles, Cultists, Lost, Mole Miners,
    Raiders, Scorched, and Super Mutants) will now use NPC versions of their weapons with balance adjustments to
    account for this change (see notes below). </div>
<div class="paragraph">When defeated these enemies will have a chance to drop the base version of their weapon
    alongside some junk items. When a weapon isn’t dropped, the enemy will instead drop more junk items that players
    can scrap to make up for the loss components you would receive from scrapping these weapons. Increases have also
    been made to the components earned from scrapping many junk items in the world, so now you will also have more
    components at your disposal. </div>
<div class="paragraph">We have also increased the rate at which you learn mods from scrapping weapons by 10% to
    account for the lower number of weapons you’ll find from these NPCs. This increase will not affect your chance
    to learn Legendary weapon mods.</div>
<ul>
    <li>All creatures previously using player weapons (Blood Eagles, Cultists, Lost, Mole Miners, Raiders, Scorched,
        Super Mutants):
        <ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: This brings these enemy types in line with other creatures whose
                        attacks already could scale to level 100.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Thrown grenades now scale with level.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: This currently only applies to enemies using grenades. Damage
                        from player grenades is unchanged.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Health, resistances, and damage now scale more smoothly from level 1 to level 100.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: These creatures will generally be less threatening at mid-level
                        (especially 35-75) but should be a bit tougher towards level 100. In some cases, at lower
                        level, these creatures may be slightly weaker or stronger in order to ensure that they’re
                        appropriately engaging even when first met.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Power Armor variants’ resistances now scale more appropriately at differing levels.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: These creatures previously would gain a flat bonus from Power
                        Armor at all levels and thus could be unexpectedly tough at low-to-mid level.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Resistances differentiated between Blood Eagles, Cultists, and Raiders.</li>
            <li>Now rely more on health as the primary driver of survivability rather than resistances.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: Resistances are being used to differentiate damage types rather
                        than as a substitute for health. This has the side benefit of showing higher damage numbers
                        when attacking these creatures which more closely match the weapons being used.</li>

    </li>
    <li>Reduced the bonus damage on most creatures’ weak points from 2.0x to 1.5x.</li>
    <li>Health for body parts generally associated with benefits for crippling limbs has been reduced. In many
        cases, it should be much easier to cripple a creature's limb before dealing enough damage to kill the
        creature.</li>
    <li>Damage to combat inhibitors for robots and turrets will result in less overall health damage to the robot,
