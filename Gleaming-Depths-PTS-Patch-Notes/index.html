<div class="paragraph"><strong>Follow up on the VATs changes made in the 10/25 PTS Update:</strong></div>
<div class="paragraph">We wanted to take a quick moment to say thank you all for the feedback around the recent
  combat balance changes that were made in the PTS. </div>
<div class="paragraph">The team has decided to revert the recent changes to VATS hit chance for now. The other
  changes (body part damage multipliers and how much damage it takes to cripple a limb) will still use the
  updated values with a few exceptions. As always, we plan to monitor and provide further updates in the
  future. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Thank you all for your feedback! </div>

<div class="update article-el-h3">Combat Balancing</div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <div class="paragraph">Made adjustments to most creatures' body part damage and VATS hit chances, reduced
      the bonus damage on most weak points from 2.0x to 1.5x.</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class="paragraph">VATS hit chance on head, limbs, and various weak points has been reduced for most
      creatures.</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class="paragraph">Adjusted VATS hit chance on a few creatures' torsos (a few are slightly higher and a
      few are slightly lower)</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class="miner-note"><strong>Miner Note</strong>: Hit chance changes were reverted on 11/2</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class="paragraph">Health for body parts generally associated with benefits for crippling limbs has been
      reduced. In many cases, it should be much easier to cripple a creature's limb before dealing enough
      damage to kill the creature.</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class="paragraph">Combat inhibitors for robots and turrets are now generally harder to target and
      damaging them will result in less overall health damage to the robot, but the combat inhibitor can now
      be destroyed much earlier, before the robot/turret has lost most of its health. (While this affects most
      creatures, this does not affect the EN06 Guardian and Ultracite Terror.)</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class="paragraph">This change should most benefit VATS targeting specific limbs for the purpose of
      gaining the benefits of crippling a creature (or destroying a combat inhibitor), as well as manually
      aiming at specific limbs outside of VATS.</div>

      be slightly more difficult.</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class="paragraph">During the encounter with Bloodhound, Lynx, and Vulture, repair bots will spawn
      faster and repair generators much more quickly.</div>
    <div class="miner-note"><strong>Miner Note</strong>: Repair bot respawn time decreased from 30s to 20s<br />Repair
      bot repair rate doubled (10% to 20%?)</div>

      damage on a direct hit.</div>

  <li>The engineers at Vault-Tec are test running their latest 3rd person petting animation in preparation for the
    arrival of our furry companions. Our Vault-Tec engineers would like to note that these animations are indeed
    prototypes. Vault-Tec does not advise attempting to pet dangerous wildlife as it could prove hazardous to

  <li>20% chance to drop the player version of whichever weapon the enemy had equipped.</li>
  <li>When not dropping a weapon, Junk items will be dropped instead.

      <li>This scales with level up to level 50.

<div class="update bnetArticle-bnetArticle38 bnetArticle-bnetArticle41 heading_md article-el-h3">The
  Gleaming Depths Raid</div>
<div class="paragraph">The Gleaming Depths raid is a new endgame activity designed to be faced
  by a party of four highly leveled and geared players. Each encounter is going to require
  your party to work together to overcome unique coop mechanics to overcome the bosses within.
  These bosses may also punish some types of character builds and we’re sure you’ll figure out
  which builds are more advantageous for each fight. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Unlike Daily Ops and Expeditions, which can be cleared solo if you have
  the correct build, the Gleaming Depths will require you and your squad to take on unique
  roles during the encounters and communicate with each other. To help facilitate
  communication, we’re also introducing a contextual Ping system to allow those who may not
  feel comfortable with being on voice comms to assist the team. When pointed towards a
  target, the ping system will mark hostile and friendly targets, points of interest, and
  containers.</div>
<div class="paragraph">When designing this activity, the team laid out five core features that
  will make raids different than other repeatable content like Daily Ops, Expeditions or World
  Bosses:</div>
<ul>
  <li>Require Teamwork</li>
  <li>Challenge Endgame Builds</li>
  <li>Unique Boss Fights</li>
  <li>No Time Gating</li>
  <li>High Value Rewards</li>
</ul>
<div class="paragraph">We’ve covered the first three bullet points in the opening paragraphs so
  now let’s cover the last two.</div>
<div class="paragraph">No time gating. Raids can be completed back-to-back without having to
  wait for a reset timer. With each encounter you clear you get rewards. This is important
  because completing these raid encounters will be your primary source of 4-Star Legendary
  Mods/Items as well as other raid related rewards.</div>
<div class="paragraph">To start the questline, go to the Gleaming Depths location in the Ash
  Heap (there’s a new Raid Map Marker to help guide you). Form your party of four and then
  enter the raid through the Ultracite Fissure. </div>
<div class="miner-note"><strong>Miner Note</strong>: 4 players are not explictly required to start a raid, your mileage
  may vary.</div>
<div class="paragraph">If you run into any issues and need to restart the questline follow these
  steps: Pip Boy &gt; Data &gt; Gleaming Depths &gt; Reject. After that, reenter the Gleaming
  Depths to pick the quest back up. </div>
<div class="paragraph">P.S. We’re aware that we’ve said nothing about the ACTUAL raid bosses.
  That’s because we want you to experience that for yourself! </div>
<div class="paragraph">If you’re someone who likes to record their gameplay, we’d love to see
  your first experience. Record it and tag @Fallout on X (formerly Twitter) so we can watch
  your clear. Surely, you’re going to one-shot it, right?</div>
<div class="bnetArticle-bnetArticle38 bnetArticle-bnetArticle41  heading_md article-el-h3">
  4-Star Legendary Items (And ENEMIES!)</div>
<div class="paragraph">With the release of the Gleaming Depths, we are expanding the current
  legendary system to take your 3-Star items and allow you turn them into 4-Star items.
  Opening a whole new avenue for you to modify your weapons and armor in ways that amplify
  your playstyle. </div>
<div class="paragraph">These 4-Star Legendary items will be obtainable as drops during the raid
  and they also have a chance to drop from the new 4-Star Legendary Creatures that will spawn
  around Appalachia. </div>
<div class="paragraph">4-Star Legendary Creatures are deadlier, faster, and tougher than the
  Legendary enemies that you’re used to. If you’re lucky (unlucky?) enough to come across one,
  you’ll also notice that they have new unique modifiers applied to them.</div>

<div class="paragraph">This all ties into the Legendary Crafting system that was introduced in
  Milepost Zero. If you have 4-Star Legendary Weapons and Armor, you’ll have a chance at
  obtaining a loose mod or learning the recipe when you scrap the item. Like Three-Star Mods,
  loose 4-Star Mods can be traded with other players. But the second you craft it on an item,
  that item becomes untradeable and you cannot drop it. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Combine the introduction of 4-Star Legendary items with the introduction
  of Raids and this is the largest expansion to our endgame yet!</div>

  Player Titles</div>
<div class="paragraph">Player Titles are a new way to express what’s unique about your Vault
  Dweller. Through your Pip-Boy, you can combine different prefixes and suffixes to come up
  with a nickname that suits you! Earnable from participating in Public Events, Limited Time
  Events, completing Main Quests, and Seasons, these unique titles will help you stand out
  from the crowd. The Gleaming Depths raid will also have its own set of titles that will be
  tied to Challenges. </div>
<div class="paragraph">For long-time players, any titles that are associated to content that
  you’ve already completed will be automatically granted to your account.</div>
<div class="paragraph">What you’ll see during the PTS and at Gleaming Depths release is just the
  start journey. Expect to see new titles in the future! </div>
<div class="paragraph"><strong>Please Note</strong>: You may need to reassign your title when
  you relog into the game. We have a fix in the works for this that will arrive in a future
  PTS update. </div>

<div class="paragraph">Say hello to two new fuzzy friends who will help bring your C.A.M.P, to life! We’re
  excited to bring C.A.M.P. Pets to Fallout 76 starting with a Cat and a Dog. And yes, you can pet them.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">You can find your C.A.M.P. Pet in the newly updated DWELLERS workshop tab and spawn
  them by placing the corresponding spawning furniture for the cat or dog - a cat bed and a doghouse. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Once placed, the animals will follow you around your C.A.M.P., idly walk, sit in their
  furniture and use their own cat scratcher or digging in their doggy bone mound. The latter furniture items
  must be placed before they will use them, and currently are found in the MISC workshop tab. </div>
<div class="paragraph">C.A.M.P. Pets will not follow you in the world - they are just that - a C.A.M.P. pet!
  You cannot have more than one at a time, but you can have one pet and one ally in your C.A.M.P.. They will
  not, however, be available in your Shelter. </div>
<div class="paragraph">To interact with your new friend, walk up to them and press the interaction buttons
  that you see when they are close. "Interact" for Pet Commands, "Customize" for Dress Up, and "Edit Name" to
  call them what you'd like (other players will NOT see your pet's name). </div>
<div class="paragraph">Through Pet Commands you can have them sit, speak, and of course, pet them through an
  emote style window. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Dress up your pet by crafting their collars at the Armor Workbench in the Headwear
  section, then use the "Customize" interaction to place them on your friend. </div>
<div class="paragraph">As well as being a cute dweller in your C.A.M.P., they will also bring you an item
  every so often! This Pet Treasure system allows your fuzzy friend to show their love for you by bringing you
  a little treat! </div>

<div class="paragraph">During Milepost Zero PTS testing and release, we made some focused changes to
  Vaccinated, Iron Stomach, Thirst Quencher, and Natural Resistance perks to make these generally
  underperforming cards more interesting and easier to incorporate into your builds. We did this by removing
  the extra ranks, lowering the cards cost, and changing the card’s effect to scale with the related primary
  stat. </div>
<div class="paragraph">In today’s PTS update, we’re continuing this process by modifying more Perk cards with

<div class="paragraph">These enemies previously shared weapons with players and now use enemy-specific variants of
  those
  weapons. As a result, these weapons can no-longer be looted after those enemies are killed. To make up for the
  loss of
  these items, we’ll be making adjustments to creature loot and scrap-to-learn chance for non-legendary mods in a
  later
  update during this PTS. </div>
<div class="paragraph">The types of health, damage, and resistance adjustments mentioned in the creatures below have
  also been applied to other creatures as part of earlier updates. We’ve included additional information here to
  help
  provide a better understanding of the changes being made. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Balance adjustments have been made for the following creatures: </div>
<ul>
  <li>All creatures previously using player weapons (Blood Eagles, Cultists, Lost, Mole Miners, Raiders, Scorched,
    Super
    Mutants):
    <ul>
      <li>Weapon damage now scales to level 100.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: As these creatures previously used player weapons, their damage would only
            scale to level 45 or 50.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Thrown grenades now scale with level.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: This currently only applies to enemies using grenades. Damage from player
            grenades is unchanged.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Health, resistances, and damage now scale more smoothly from level 1 to level 100.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: These creatures will generally be less threatening at mid-level (especially
            35-75) but should be a bit tougher towards level 100. In some cases at lower level, these creatures may
            be
            slightly weaker or stronger in order to ensure that they’re appropriately engaging even when first met.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Power Armor variants’ resistances now scale more appropriately at differing levels.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: These creatures previously would gain a flat bonus from Power Armor at all
            levels and thus could be unexpectedly tough at low-to-mid level.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Resistances differentiated between Blood Eagles, Cultists, and Raiders.</li>
      <li>Now relies more on health as the primary driver of survivability rather than resistances.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: Resistances are being used to differentiate damage types rather than as a
            substitute for health. This has the side benefit of showing higher damage numbers when attacking these
            creatures which more closely match the weapons being used.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>No-longer gains a variable amount of resistances based on randomized armor.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Reduced the cryo damage for the blast/stare/shockwave attack (the one which also deals fusion core
        damage).
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="miner-note"><strong>Miner Note</strong>: Slow effect duration decreased from 6s to 5s.<br />

<div class="paragraph">The following Magazines have been updated. For the most part, these are direct increases to

<ul>
  <li>Astoundingly Awesome Tales 7: +25 max AP, up from +5.</li>
  <li>Astoundingly Awesome Tales 10: +35% more damage with scoped weapons while aiming, previously +15% without

        aim
        and does not affect VATS.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Backwoodsman 2: Name and cover art updated to match effect.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: This is a purely cosmetic change for the magazine’s name and cover. It was
        previously swapped with Backwoodsman 7 (see below).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Backwoodsman 6: Now only affects healing from cooked foods, rather than all effects from cooked food.</li>
  <li>Backwoodsman 7 (name and cover art updated to match effect): Now affects all thrown weapons (Sheepsquatch
    Shard,
    Tomahawk, Throwing Knife, Meat Cleaver) instead of just Tomahawks.</li>
  <li>Live and Love 1: +25 max HP while on a team, up from 10.</li>
  <li>Live and Love 3: Now only affects healing from fruits &amp; veggies, rather than all effects from fruits &amp;

  <li>Grognak the Barbarian 3: +25 poison resistance, up from 15.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Scout's Life 3: Now reduces all items' weight by 10%, instead of +10 carry weight.</li>
  <li>Scout's Life 9: Now provides +25 fire resistance, instead of -80% camp placement cost.</li>
  <li>US Covert operations Manual 1: +50 damage resistance while sneaking, up from +10 while sneaking.</li>
</ul>
<div class="paragraph">Backwoodsman 6 and Live and Love 3 far exceeded the intended level of benefit for magazines

  have been adjusted to match their original effect of boosting Healing from food items. Backwoodsman 6’s prior
  change
  in the Once in a Blue Moon update had been made in error, and we apologize for the confusion. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Prior to this update, these magazines boosted all foods effects, including (but not limited)

<div class="paragraph">A suite of new accessibility features are coming to the game with this update! </div>
<div class="paragraph">When you enter the game for the first time, you’ll be presented with the Accessibility Menu
  that
  includes the new settings. This will only appear once and if you need to change any of these settings in the
  future,
  go to Settings &gt; Accessibility. </div>
<div class="paragraph"><strong>Speech-to-Text</strong></div>
<div class="paragraph">Turning Speech-to-Text ON will add a new message window to the UI that will transcribe all
  voice
  communication from other players in the area. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Message Window Fade Time – Changes how long the message window stays on screen after the last
  message has been received. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Message Window Visibility – Changes the transparency of the message window. </div>
<div class="paragraph"><strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> </div>
<ul>
  <li>Turning Text-to-Speech ON will allow players to type text into the message window and have that text converted
    into audible speech for other players in the area who have Text-to-Speech ON.</li>
  <li>Text-to-Speech Voice – Allows you to choose between a masculine or feminine voice type.</li>
  <li>Chat Volume – Allows you to adjust the volume of the incoming text-to-speech audio.</li>

</ul>
<div class="paragraph"><strong>UI Navigation</strong></div>
<ul>
  <li>Digital Input
    <ul>
      <li>Several screens relied completely on analog stick input and that has been addressed to allow keyboard
        control
        on PCs and d-pad control on consoles. This includes the Challenges, Scoreboard, Map, and Character Creation
        screens.</li>

  <li>Analog Input
